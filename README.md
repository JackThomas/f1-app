This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) 15 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, to install run the following:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

As there are a couple conflicts with packages and the new next.js react versions.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
